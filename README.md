As of 4/26/2017 I'm handing this repo off to others to fork and continue if they wish.  Thanks to doomedraven, KillerInstinct, kevross33, SeanKim77, jgajek, keithjjones, pashashocky, Shane-Carr, seanthegeek, garanews, and all the other contributors I forgot to mention.

This fork aims to continue the work of the heavily modified version of the upstream [Cuckoo Sandbox](http://www.cuckoosandbox.org) cuckoomon provided under the GPL by Optiv.

32/64-bit compiled versions of this software are provided in our cuckoo-modified repository.
Please see that repository for more information on the changes to this edition of cuckoomon.
